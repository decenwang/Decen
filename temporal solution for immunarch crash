Because of the updated R version, the latest R 4.0.1 might not be compatible well with the immunarch 0.6.5, when I try to install the immunarch 0.6.5, 
it cannot be installed due to unknown reasons. when I attempt to use the immunarch 0.6.4, it also cannot be installed again.
but luckily, I have installed the immunarch 0.6.4 in our workstation with R 3.6.0.
Anyway, the file is more than 1Gbï¼ŒI cannot upload, if you need, let me know, we try to crack it.
Immunarch is really a nice job by Dr. Nazarov. If you can combine with ggplot2 and other packages, you can get good results.
